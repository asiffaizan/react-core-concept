# About
This is for learning core concepts of react.js.


# Basics of hocks

# useState
useState is a hook. It is used to change the state of a variable. The useState hook returns an array with two elements. The first element is the current value of the variable, and the second element is a state setter function that is used to update the value of the variable.

# useEffect
useEffect is a hook. It is used to perform side effects in your components. It is similar to componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate. It is called after every render of the component. The useEffect hook accepts a callback function as its first parameter. The callback function is called after the render is committed to the screen. The useEffect hook also accepts an optional second parameter. The second parameter is an array of dependencies. If the dependencies don’t change, the callback function won’t be called. If the dependencies change, the callback function will be called. If the second parameter is not provided, the callback function will be called after every render.


# Keys
in React keys are a unique identifier for each element in an array.
DOM: DOM is a Document object model. It is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated. It also defines the way in which the structure is manipulated and presented to the user.

# Reconciliation
The process of comparing the old virtual DOM tree to the new one and calculating the minimum number of changes required to update the actual DOM is known as reconciliation. React compares the new virtual DOM tree to the old one when a component is rerendered and detects the sections of the tree that have changed

# React and ReactDOM
What is the difference between React and ReactDOM? The difference between React and ReactDOM is that React is a JavaScript library for building the user interface while ReactDOM is a package that provides DOM specific methods that can be used at the top level of the web app to enable an efficient way of DOM manipulation.

# React Hooks
Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class. Hooks are backwards-compatible.

# React js
How react works? 
It is used to create user interfaces and is typically employed on the client side of web applications. React works with back-end technologies and can communicate with server-side code to fetch data
