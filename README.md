# useState
useState is a hook. It is used to change the state of a variable. The useState hook returns an array with two elements. The first element is the current value of the variable, and the second element is a state setter function that is used to update the value of the variable.

# useEffect
useEffect is a hook. It is used to perform side effects in your components. It is similar to componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate. It is called after every render of the component. The useEffect hook accepts a callback function as its first parameter. The callback function is called after the render is committed to the screen. The useEffect hook also accepts an optional second parameter. The second parameter is an array of dependencies. If the dependencies don’t change, the callback function won’t be called. If the dependencies change, the callback function will be called. If the second parameter is not provided, the callback function will be called after every render.
